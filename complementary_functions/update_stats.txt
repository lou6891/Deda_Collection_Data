THe historical data give only the floor price (overall lowest), at 00.
So either we give them, and after we dispay all of the data, or we keep that format and dislay only the 00.

Let's set it up so that if there are the most accurate data it will display them,
if not it will only display at 00 (24 h , 48 h , 7 days, 30 days) => all data
60 days , 180 days , 1 year , max only at 00

documents to create,
